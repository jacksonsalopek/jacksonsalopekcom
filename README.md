Svelte Web App for displaying my resume, works and experiments.

## Developing

Once dependencies are installed with `yarn` (or `pnpm install` or `npm install`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn start

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn start -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
